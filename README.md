### Data Source
This map was made in QGIS by importing state and county lines and data from the United States Census information, and querying museums and cultural institutions and colleges and universities through open street maps.

### Project Background

I chose to complete these queries after reading The Injustice of Place (2023, Edin, Nelson, Shaefer), which identified several parts the appalachian region in Kentucky and West Virginia as some of the most deeply disadvantaged places in the US (in addition to parts of the Mississippi delta and southern Texas) due to their histories of internal-colonization and resource extraction. Considering the disparities of wealth and resources in those communities, I was curious to see where cultural institutions and educational resources existed in and surrounding some of the most economically disadvantaged places in the US. 

### Purpose

I created this map to visually communicate the concentration of educational and cultural institutions in and around the most economically distressed area of the appalachian region (eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia, per the Appalachian Regional Commission, or ARC).

I attempted to find enconomic data to incorporate into my map, to better demonstrate the relationship. I was not able to access open-source data specific to counties within this region, however, I suggest looking at the ARC's [Classifying Economic Distress in Appalachian Counties]([https://www.arc.gov/classifying-economic-distress-in-appalachian-counties/]) for context.

### Mapmaking Process

You can describe the mapmapking process in this section, including images where it helps to describe the process.

You can also use some lists, and here's some formatting ideas.

1. **Example bold**
2. *Example italics*
